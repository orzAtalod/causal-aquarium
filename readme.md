## Why Rust?

1. **High performance**: Rust is extremely fast, comparable to C++, which is important for running real-time simulations efficiently.
2. **Strong type system**: Rust's type system helps catch many errors at compile time, improving reliability of experimental code.
3. **Pattern matching**: Rust's powerful pattern matching simplifies handling of experimental states and events.
4. **Memory safety**: Rust manages memory safely without a garbage collector, reducing runtime errors and making code easier to maintain.
5. **Comprehensive ecosystem**: Rust provides tools and libraries for many areas, allowing functional extensions, though its ecosystem is still developing compared to Python.
